# Wunderlist Clone Backend

Wunderlist 2.0 takes your traditional to-do list app and automates it. It not only allows you to write your to-do, work, grocery, trip and household lists, but allows you to set up recurring to do lists by date and time. (Think recurring events on google calendar + to-do list app). No matter how much is on your plate, Wunderlist 2.0 makes it super easy to remember all the little recurring to-dos and surprise to-dos that pop up unexpectedly.

## Tech Stack

Backend is built on Nodejs and PostgreSQL

Libraries used include:
- express

## API Documentation

API documentation can be found [Here](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6872970/SzKbLaR9) on Postman


## Challenges

Using Joi to validate dates, we did not achieve our goal (time and quality constraints), therefore we switched to using regex in a middleware to validate dates.
